# DEEP (Extended Release)

DEEP is an open source, community driven web application to intelligently
collect, tag, analyze and export secondary data. This repository contains code
for DEEP 2.0, a large full-stack rewrite of DEEP 1.0.

DEEP's brain is powered by DEEPL, an suite of tools to provide NLP
recommendations to the platform. Its code can be found
[here](https://github.com/the-deep/DEEPL).
